A statechart mixin for SproutCore clients. To install, cd into the top-level of your sproutcore application (the one with sc-config in it) and do:

  sc-install onitunes-statechart

Then edit your sc-config to include the framework:

  c[:required] = [:sproutcore, :'onitunes-statechart']

You'll need to restart sc-server to see the change.
